# Face_recognition_app
Phase1 focuses on collecting, organizing and preprocessing face images for training a face recognition model, this includes face extraction using the HAAR cascade classifier and saving the preprocessed data in a compressed format.

Phase 2 focuses on generating face embeddings from the preprocessed dataset using the FaceNet model. These embeddings are numerical representations of faces that will be used for the recognition task.
